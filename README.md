# MSc Data Science Dissertation
This dissertation investigates implicit cultural bias in user-curated Afro-centric playlists on Spotify and examines its implications for cross-cultural music representation within African music ecosystems. While existing research has largely focused on algorithmic and editorial curation, limited attention has been given to how user-generated playlists may reproduce or amplify structural inequalities in cultural visibility. Using data collected from Spotify’s Web API, this study analyses 52 user-curated Afro-centric playlists alongside 5 algorithmically curated playlists, encompassing over 5,900 tracks, 2,200 albums, 332 genres, and 171 artist nationalities.
